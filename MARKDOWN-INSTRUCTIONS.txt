Hello dear customer!

The Markdown files is found by going to the static
folder, then the markdown folder. This is were all the
markdown files can be accessed and edited.

You can use the following tags in your Markdown documents.
They will automatically display the correct information.


- $DATA_PROTECTION_OFFICER_EMAIL_ADDRESS = Shows the company's dpo email.
- $SUPPORT_EMAIL_ADDRESS = Shows the company's support email.
- $SUPPORT_PHONE_NUMBER = Shows the company's support phone number.
- $HEADQUARTERS_ADDRESS = Shows the company's headquarters address.


These tags pull their values from the .env file in the
root of the project's folder structure. For example
in the .env file, you will see lines like this:


- PUBLIC_DATA_PROTECTION_OFFICER_EMAIL_ADDRESS="a-email-address"
- PUBLIC_SUPPORT_EMAIL_ADDRESS="a-email-address"
- PUBLIC_SUPPORT_PHONE_NUMBER="a-phone-number"
- PUBLIC_HEADQUARTERS_ADDRESS="a-address"


When you use the tags in your document, they will automatically
use the values from the .env file.
