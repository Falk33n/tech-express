## Our History

TechExpress was founded in 2017 with a clear vision: to make high-quality technology accessible to everyone. We started as a small online store with big dreams and have since grown to become one of Sweden's most trusted retailers of tech products.

Our success is built on three pillars: **quality**, **knowledge**, and **customer service**. We carefully curate our product range to ensure that our customers always receive products of the highest quality. Our knowledgeable staff consists of tech enthusiasts who love sharing their expertise.

Today, we have four physical stores across Sweden and a growing e-commerce business. We continue to evolve and adapt to our customers' needs, always with the goal of making tech purchases a smooth and secure experience.
